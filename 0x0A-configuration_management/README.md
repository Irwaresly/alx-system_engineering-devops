# 0x0A-configuration_management

This repository contains Puppet manifests for basic configuration management tasks. The tasks include creating a file, installing a package, and executing a command using Puppet.

## General Information

### Intro to Configuration Management
Configuration management is the practice of automating the provisioning and management of infrastructure through code. Puppet is a widely-used configuration management tool.

### Puppet Resource Type: File
The `file` resource type in Puppet is used to manage files and directories, specifying their paths, permissions, ownership, and content.

### Puppet's Declarative Language
Puppet uses a declarative language, allowing users to specify the desired state of the system rather than the steps to achieve it. This promotes a model-driven approach to configuration management.

### Puppet Lint
Puppet lint is a tool used to check Puppet manifests for style guide compliance and potential issues.

## Puppet Installation

To install Puppet, run the following commands on your Ubuntu 20.04 VM:

```bash
$ apt-get install -y ruby=1:2.7+1 --allow-downgrades
$ apt-get install -y ruby-augeas
$ apt-get install -y ruby-shadow
$ apt-get install -y puppet
```

Also, install Puppet lint:

```bash
$ gem install puppet-lint
```

## Project Structure

### 0-create_a_file.pp

Puppet manifest that creates a file in `/tmp` with specific permissions, owner, group, and content.

Usage:

```bash
puppet apply 0-create_a_file.pp
```

### 1-install_a_package.pp

Puppet manifest to install Flask from pip3 with a specified version.

Usage:

```bash
puppet apply 1-install_a_package.pp
```

### 2-execute_a_command.pp

Puppet manifest that uses the `exec` resource to kill a process named `killmenow` using `pkill`.

Usage:

```bash
puppet apply 2-execute_a_command.pp
```

## Puppet Manifests

All Puppet manifests files must end with the extension `.pp`. Ensure they pass puppet-lint without errors.
