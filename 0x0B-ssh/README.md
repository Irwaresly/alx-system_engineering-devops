# 0x0B-ssh

This repository contains Bash scripts and configuration files related to SSH (Secure Shell) for connecting to remote servers using RSA key pairs. The project focuses on understanding server concepts, SSH, and key pair authentication.

## General Information

### What is a server?
A server is a physical or virtual machine that provides resources, services, or functionalities to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

### Where servers usually live
Servers can be located in data centers, which are facilities housing a large number of servers and networking equipment, providing infrastructure for hosting applications and data.

### What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication over a computer network. It is widely used for connecting to remote servers securely.

### How to create an SSH RSA key pair
An SSH RSA key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The key pair can be generated using the `ssh-keygen` command.

### How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
Use the `ssh` command with the appropriate options and specify the private key file for authentication.

### The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash
`#!/usr/bin/env bash` is more flexible than `#!/bin/bash` as it allows for searching the system's PATH for the Bash interpreter. This ensures compatibility across different systems.

## Project Structure

### 0-use_a_private_key

Bash script that connects to a server using SSH with the private key `~/.ssh/school` and the user `ubuntu`.

Usage:
```bash
./0-use_a_private_key
```

### 1-create_ssh_key_pair

Bash script that creates an RSA key pair with a private key named `school`, protected by the passphrase `betty`.

Usage:
```bash
./1-create_ssh_key_pair
```

### 2-ssh_config

SSH client configuration file that specifies the use of the private key `~/.ssh/school` and refuses authentication using a password.

### 3-let_me_in

Add the provided SSH public key to the server, allowing connection using the `ubuntu` user.

### 100-puppet_ssh_config.pp

Puppet script for configuring the SSH client to use the private key `~/.ssh/school` and refuse password authentication.

Usage:
```bash
sudo puppet apply 100-puppet_ssh_config.pp
```
